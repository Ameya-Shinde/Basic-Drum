- We have one H1 tag and 7 Buttons for different sounds
- All the buttons are in a container which has a property of display-flex and flex-wrap.
- changes to font formating are done using font-size and font-family css properties
- we have created a switch case for each sound and used event listener. When a key is pressed, the provided function is executed, and it retrieves the pressed key using event.key.
- We have also used the onclick property to pass the keyvalue on mouse click as well.
